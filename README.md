go-cron
=========

Simple golang wrapper over `github.com/robfig/cron` and `os/exec` as a cron replacement. 
Additionally the application opens a HTTP port that can be used as a healthcheck.

## usage

`go-cron -s "* * * * * *" -p 8080 -- /bin/bash -c "echo 1"`

Check the healthcheck:

```
$ curl -v localhost:18080                                                                                                              ⏎ ✱ ◼
